					<h3 className={css.subtitle}>10. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
					<p>10.1. Disclaimer</p>
					<p>
						We make no express or implied warranties or representations with
						respect to the Affiliate Program, about Company or the Commission
						payment arrangements (including, without limitation, functionality,
						warranties of fitness, merchantability, legality or
						non-infringement). In addition, we make no representation that the
						operation of our sites will be uninterrupted or error-free and will
						not be liable for the consequences if there are any. In the event of
						a discrepancy between the reports offered in the Affiliate Account
						system and the Company database, the database shall be deemed
						accurate.
					</p>
					<p>10.2. Indemnity and Limitation of Liability</p>
					<p>
						You shall indemnify and hold Company, our directors, employees and
						representatives harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
						losses, damages and costs, including legal fees, resulting from or
						in any way connected with (a) any breach by you of any provision of
						the Affiliate Agreement, (b) the performance of your duties and
						obligations under the Affiliate Agreement, (c) your negligence or
						(d) any injury caused directly or indirectly by your negligent or
						intentional acts or omissions, or the unauthorised use of our
						creatives and links or this Affiliate Program.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Company shall not be held liable for any direct or indirect,
						special, or consequential damages (or any loss of revenue, profits,
						or data), any loss of goodwill or reputation arising in connection
						with the Affiliate Agreement or the Affiliate Program, even if we
						have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
					</p>
					<p>10.3. Non-Waiver</p>
					<p>
						Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of
						the Affiliate Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to
						subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of the
						Affiliate Agreement.
					</p>
					<p>10.4. Relationship of Parties</p>
					<p>
						The Company and the Affiliate are independent contractors and
						nothing in the Affiliate Agreement will create any partnership,
						joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or
						employment relationship between us. You will have no authority to
						make or accept any offers or representations on our behalf. You will
						not make any statement, whether on your site or otherwise, that
						would contradict anything in this Affiliate Agreement.
					</p>
					<p>10.5. Force Majeure</p>
					<p>
						Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure
						to perform its obligations under the Affiliate Agreement if such
						delay or failure arises from a cause beyond its reasonable control,
						including but not limited to labour disputes, strikes, industrial
						disturbances, acts of God, acts of terrorism, floods, lightning,
						utility or communications failures, earthquakes or other casualty.
						If such event occurs, the non-performing Party is excused from
						whatever performance is prevented by the event to the extent
						prevented provided that if the force majeure event subsists for a
						period exceeding thirty (30) calendar days then either Party may
						terminate the Affiliate Agreement with immediate effect by providing
						a written notice.
					</p>
					<p>10.6. Assignability</p>
					<p>
						You may not assign the Affiliate Agreement, by operation of law or
						otherwise, without our prior written consent.
					</p>
					<p>10.7. Severability</p>
					<p>
						If any provision of the Affiliate Agreement is held to be invalid,
						illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be
						ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, or
						unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of the
						Affiliate Agreement or any provision hereof.
					</p>
					<p>10.8 English Language</p>
					<p>
						This Agreement is drafted in English. In the event of discrepancies
						between translations, the English version shall prevail.
					</p>
					<p>10.9. Modification of Terms &amp; Conditions</p>
					<p>
						We may modify any of the terms and conditions contained in the
						Affiliate Agreement or replace it at any time and in our sole
						discretion by posting a change notice or a new agreement on our
						site. Modifications may include, for example, changes in the scope
						of available Commissions and Affiliate Program rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						If any modification is unacceptable to you, your need to terminate
						the Affiliate Agreement. Your continued participation in our
						Affiliate Program following our posting of a change notice or new
						agreement will constitute binding acceptance of the modification or
						of the new agreement.
